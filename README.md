Python Assignment

This repository contains the Python scripts for my Task 1 and Task 2 assignments.

Task 1: Even or Odd Number (task1.py)

In this script, the program asks the user to enter a number. It then checks whether the given number is even or odd using the modulus (%) operator and displays the result using an if-else condition.

Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50 (task2.py)

This script calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. The program adds each number to a total variable and finally prints the total sum on the screen.
