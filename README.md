Python Assignment #

This repository contains the Python scripts for my Task 1 and Task 2 assignments.

## Task 1: Math Operations (`task1.py`)
In this script, I ask the user to type in two numbers. Then, the program calculates the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for those numbers and prints the results on the screen using f-strings.

## Task 2: Personalized Greeting (`task2.py`)
This program asks the user for their first name and last name separately. I combined these two inputs to make a "full name" variable. Finally, the program prints a customized welcome message using that full name.
